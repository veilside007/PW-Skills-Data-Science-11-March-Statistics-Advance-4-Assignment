    "Q1: What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would\n",

    "\n",
    "The main difference between a t-test and a z-test lies in the assumptions about the population standard deviation and the sample size. Here's a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Population Standard Deviation**:\n",
    "   - **Z-test**: Assumes that the population standard deviation is known.\n",
    "   - **t-test**: Suitable when the population standard deviation is unknown and must be estimated from the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sample Size**:\n",
    "   - **Z-test**: Generally used when the sample size is large (typically n > 30).\n",
    "   - **t-test**: Suitable for smaller sample sizes, especially when n < 30. However, for larger sample sizes, the t-test converges to the z-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Distribution**:\n",
    "   - **Z-test**: Assumes the sampling distribution of the sample mean follows a normal distribution.\n",
    "   - **t-test**: Assumes the sampling distribution of the sample mean follows a Student's t-distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Critical Values**:\n",
    "   - **Z-test**: Uses critical values from the standard normal distribution (z-table).\n",
    "   - **t-test**: Uses critical values from the t-distribution, which vary based on the sample size and degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Precision**:\n",
    "   - **Z-test**: More precise when the assumptions are met (known population standard deviation, large sample size).\n",
    "   - **t-test**: More robust to violations of assumptions, making it suitable for smaller sample sizes and situations where the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Z-test Example**: Suppose you want to test whether the mean height of a population is significantly different from a known value (e.g., national average height). If you have a large sample size (e.g., n > 30) and the population standard deviation is known (perhaps from previous studies), you could use a z-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **t-test Example**: Consider a scenario where you're investigating the effectiveness of a new teaching method on student performance. You randomly assign students to two groups (experimental and control) and measure their test scores. Since you don't know the population standard deviation and the sample sizes are relatively small (e.g., n < 30), you would use a t-test to compare the mean test scores of the two groups."

    "\n",
    "   Critical Region:\n",
    "   - Reject \\(H_0\\) if the test statistic falls in the left tail of the distribution (for a left-tailed test).\n",

    "2. **Two-tailed Test**:\n",
    "   - **Directionality**: In a two-tailed test, the hypothesis does not specify a direction of the effect being tested. It only tests for the possibility of a difference.\n",

    "A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of a population parameter.
